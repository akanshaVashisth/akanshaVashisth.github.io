The control for the level of surveillance for the data science products according to me as a data scientist should be strictly dependent on the product requirements and customer confidentiality. Till the surveillance is not affecting customer confidentiality, then I would use the maximum surveillance, as the surveillance starts affecting customer confidentiality, I would pause the surveillance.

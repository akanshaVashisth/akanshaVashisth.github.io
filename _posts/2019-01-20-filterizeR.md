**filterizeR** is a user-friendly package that performs digital image processing on images. It encompasses functions ranging from transformations like a simple flip, playing with color hues (rgb2gray) to 2D convolutions using a simple kernel matrix to do some interesting things. The package allows users to efficiently use image processing filters using convolutions.

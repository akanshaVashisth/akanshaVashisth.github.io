Cancer is an open-ended problem till date. It is one of biggest research areas of medical science. There are many types of cancers which are rapidly getting common. It is estimated that 41,400 deaths (40,920 women and 480 men) from breast cancer will occur this year 2018. We were highly interested to use machine learning models to dive in Breast Cancer Coimbra Data Set and explore about breast cancer predictions.

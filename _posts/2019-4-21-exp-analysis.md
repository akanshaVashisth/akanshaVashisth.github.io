It is common for students to arrive late in lectures.  We were curious to know if there could be a specific reason underlying such choice. After some brainstorming, we came up with the hypothesis that a person's choice of arriving late might be due to their **Distance from campus** and **Transportation**. We have set the goal to explore such causal relationship (if there exists one) with data in our data analysis project.
